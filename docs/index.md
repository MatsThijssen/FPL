# Fixture Difficulty Rating
Fixture Difficulty Rating (FDR) is one of the most useful tools to plan player transfers in FPL. The idea is to quantify the toughness of competition a team will face in their upcoming games. This will give an estimate of how easy it will be for a team to score or keep a clean sheet. FPL provides an "official" FDR [here](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/fixtures/fdr), however it has a number of issues:
1. It does not separate between offense and defense.
Some teams are notable stronger offensively than defensively (e.g. Leeds) or vice versa (e.g. Wolves). If you are looking at bringing in an attacker, you ideally want them from playing teams that are weak at the back. On the other hand, when thinking about defenders, clean sheets are important, and thus you would like them to face teams that might have lesser attacking output.
